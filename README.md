# training-introduction-to-machine-code

## Overview

This repo is intended to contain training material and example code for 
learning about machine code.  The idea is to help those that are new to 
programming to get an understanding of how computers work at a low level.

In order to do this the material is going to make use of a fairly old, but
relatively simple, and (IMHO), well-loved, CPU, the 6502.  Thankfully there 
are lots of emulators, tools, and even hardware out there that can run 
6502 machine code thanks to the efforts of many people.

## Pre-requisites

* Python - this is for running the simple 6502 examples
* TeX - specifically the TeXLive distribution for the slides and other material



## Notes

### Installing TeX Live on a Mac

Download the installer from [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html)

This is actually quite large (4Gb) so can take some time to download




### Installing on Linux

TODO
