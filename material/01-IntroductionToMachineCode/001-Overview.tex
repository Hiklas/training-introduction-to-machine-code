      \note<1>[item]{If you have a light switch with an on/off position this is often just two contacts, one unused}
    \item

\begin{frame}{More Switches, but Why?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    We can have switches in parallel so if either is ``on'' the LED lights, this is OR
  \item
    We can have one switch in series with two in parallel - OR and AND
  \item
    We could have lots and lots of switches making up quite complicated circuits
  \item
    Why would we do that though?  How does this related to computers or programming?

    \item
      Start with the units (0-9) 
    \item
      Next move onto 10s (carry any extra 10s from units)
    \item
      Then hundreds (again adding in any 100s carried from 10s)
    \item
      And so on\dots
    \item
      Maths that most of us learn how to do and some still use\dots
    \item
      Well all of us still use, even if you didn't know you did
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How Many Fingers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    We all use 10 as the basis for counting - 10 fingers, 10 toes
  \item
    This is actually called base 10 in mathematics
  \item
    There are other numbers bases that are commonly used
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Base 12 well it was commonly used by Eygptians 
    \item
      Base 16 also called hexadecimal
    \item
      Base 8 also called octal
    \item
      Base 2 also called binary
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The last one is most interesting here

      Then 4s (again adding in any 4s carried from 2ss)
    \item
      And so on\dots
    \item
      Exactly the same rules with use for base 10
    \item
      The columns in binary aren't units, 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc

      Instead units (1s), 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, 64s, 128s, 256s, etc

\subsection[Putting It Together]{Binary Logic}

\begin{frame}{Switches And Binary}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.75\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Binary only has two digits, ``0'' and ``1'' 
    \item
      You can think of these as ``off'' and ``on'' for switches
    \item
      Electric circuits have a ``+'' and ``-'' (also known as ``+ve'' and ``\SI{0}{\volt}'')
    \item
      You can represents binary with ``+ve'' and ``\SI{0}{\volt}'', 1 and 0 respectively
    \item
      Binary logic can be implemented in electronics with switches
    \end{itemize}
    
    \column{0.25\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{../assets/9V-Battery.eps}
    
  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Logic Levels}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    ``on'' is \SI{5}{\volt} or \SI{3.3}{\volt} or even \SI{1.8}{\volt}
  \item
    ``off'' is \SI{0}{\volt} (the negative terminal on a battery)
  \item
    ``on'' is 1 in binary 
  \item
    ``off'' is 0 in binary
  \item
    A single switch can be used to represent a binary digit (0 and 1)
  \item
    Two switches means 1s and 2s
  \item
    8 switches can represent any whole number between 0 and 255
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Chips}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.7\textwidth}

    \item
      There were two main types TTL and CMOS
    \item
      Transistor Transistor Logic - now superceded
    \item
      Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
    \item
      Now almost everything is CMOS - don't touch!
    \item
      What is inside chips?

    \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{../assets/IC-Picture.eps}
  \end{columns}    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Logic Gates}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Actually seen these before - switches
  \item
    Combinations of inputs result in outputs
  \item
    Two switches that both need to be ``on'' give logical AND
  \item
    Two switches either of which can be ``on'' is a logical OR
  \item
    Switches connect voltages (battery) to outputs which indicate logic levels/binary
  \item
    Chips can contain billions of switches, lets start small ...
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{AND Gate}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.7\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Both inputs must be ``on'' aka binary ``1''
    \item
      Output for this condition is ``1''
    \item
      For any other combination output is ``off'' aka binary ``0''
    \item
      Remember that ``1'' is also a certain voltage level and ``0'', is \SI{0}{\volt}
    \item
      Truth table shows the relationship between input and output
    \end{itemize}

      Either input can be ``on'' aka binary ``1''

      You get a ``0'' or ``off'' only when both inputs are ``0''

      \hline
    \end{tabular}    
  \end{columns}    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{More Logic Gates}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    ``AND'' and ``OR'' very much like their English meanings
  \item
    There are other gates, XOR, NOT (we saw this already, ``off'' means ``on'')
  \item
    Also combination gates, NAND, NOR - AND and OR with a NOT respectively
  \item
    Why do we have logic gates?  What use are they?
  \item
    On their own they can have some use, e.g. burglar alarm with multiple sensors, and one can trip the alarm, this would be an OR gate with multiple inputs
  \item
    Compare two binary numbers can be done with several XNOR (Exclusive NOR) gates and an AND gate with multiple inputs (one for each digit being compared)
  \item
    Side note: NOR, XNOR, and others can be constructed from AND/NAND OR/NOR combinations
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{More Exotic Gates}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Individual gates, or small collections, can be useful in circuits
  \item
    Ultimately though we're looking at computing
  \item
    How can gates be used to create a Central Processing Unit (CPU)?
  \item
    How can gates help with connecting the CPU to the outside world?
  \item
    How can gates help with storage of program and data in a computer?
  \item
    Simple answer have LOTS of gates to construct more complex circuits
  \item
    Remeber though: the basic building blocks are still, ultimately, switches
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection[LogicComponents]{Doing Sums With Gates}

\begin{frame}{Adding Two Binary Digits}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.6\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      In binary add two numbers less than 2 - remember number bases
    \item
      Addition of binary numbers can be written as a truth table
    \item
      Given the truth table there are ways to convert into standard gates
    \item
      Result and carry - the carry is the number of twos from the sum, 1 or 0
    \item
      Only three possible answers 0, 1, or 2 - which is 0 units and carry 
    \item
      A1, A2 addends for sum, R is result, and C carry
    \end{itemize}
    

    \column{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
      \hline
      \textbf{A1} & \textbf{A2} & \textbf{R} & \textbf{C}\\
      \hline
      0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
      1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
      1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{columns}  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{More Arithmetic}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Binary addition can be carried out by circuits called full adders
  \item
    You can also mark binary numbers as negative which gives subtraction
  \item
    This uses something called two's complement
  \item
    Can be implemented easily in gates
  \item
    Binary multiplication and division are harder but still can be implemented
  \item
    A CPU can contain circuits for basic arithmetic operations on integer numbers
  \item
    Now, CPUs also contain circuits for floating point operations - this is beyond the scope of our discussion
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection[memory]{Remembering Results}

\begin{frame}{Flip flops}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A circuit that maintains a state based on input
  \item
    Latches data given to it and ``clocked'' in 
  \item
    Basis of some memory inside CPUs, e.g. registers
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Registers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    One flip-flop can store a single binary digit (bit) of data
  \item
    Using eight flip-flops can store a byte of data, 32, 64, etc
  \item
    CPUs have ``registers'' for storage of operands and results
  \item
    Registers maintain the state of the CPU at any given time
  \item
    Flip-flips can also be used to buffer data read from memory
  \item
    Some memory external to the CPU uses flip-flops/latches (cache, SRAM)
  \item
    Main memory is something else, DRAM for example, or Flash memory
